# MNIST Digit Classification with Keras

This project implements a neural network using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses a Sequential model with Flatten and Dense layers, and applies the softmax activation function for classification.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates:
- Loading and visualizing the MNIST dataset.
- Building a neural network with two hidden layers using Keras.
- Training the model with the training data.
- Predicting and displaying the results for the test set.
